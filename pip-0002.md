# PIP-2: Perspective View Web Component Interface spec.

AD4M [Perspectives](https://github.com/perspect3vism/ad4m/blob/main/src/perspectives/Perspective.ts) can be rendered and interacted with in many different ways.

The thinking behind AD4M is that there can and should be many different UIs to visualized all or parts of the same Perspective. These different UIs can take the form of applications that connect to the AD4M-executor and select *their* Perspective(s) to visualize.

But already for both first AD4M applications, Junto's [Flux](https://github.com/juntofoundation/flux) and [Perspect3ve](https://github.com/perspect3vism/perspect3ve), we are dealing with multiple Prespectives (all Perspectives in the case of Perspect3ve) that should be displayed and interacted with in different ways: 
 * as graph
 * as chat thread
 * as plain list of links for debugging
 * ...

There is nothing conceptually stopping us from regarding these different ways of displaying of and interacting with Perspectives as re-usable componentes, that are largely independent from the actual app in which they are used (Flux / Perspect3ve / ...) and thus could be build as web components and shared between apps.

For that to pragmatically work out, we have to agree on an interface for these web components - that is agree on their **properties**, **events** and **methods**.

## Properties

- `perspective-uuid`: *string*
- `ad4m-client`: *Ad4mClient*

The Perspective View component needs to be initialized with the Perspective to render and with access to it.

The combination of the Perspective's ID and an initialized [`Ad4mClient`](https://github.com/perspect3vism/ad4m/blob/main/src/Ad4mClient.ts) object is all that's needed since the component can retrieve a PerspectiveProxy object via the client with the given ID and then do all queries and mutation through that proxy.

There was some discussion around passing in an `Ad4mClient` or having the component create one. We decided for passing it in and thus leaving the concern about matching versions between `Ad4mClient` and the AD4M-executor to the app that uses the Perspective View component. Otherwise updates to the AD4M-executor interface would potentially break Perspective View components and force apps to either wait for the component developer to update their code, or stick to an old version to keep the used Perspective View(s).

## Events

Perspective Views trigger the following DOM events with corresponding parameters:

- `agent-click` (did)
- `agent-viewed` (did)
- `expression-click` (url)
- `expression-viewed` (url)
- `expression-blur` (url)
- `perspective-click` (perspective-uuid)
- `perspective-viewed` (perspective-uuid)
- `external-click` (url)
 
The last one, external-click, is triggered when a web 2.0 link was clicked that should be opened externally in another app.

### Discussion

Do we need to define a router? Or router specific events like:
- go-to-home
- go-back
- ...
  
?

## Methods

- `revealExpression(url: string)`
  Scrolls or zooms to the given expression.
- `selectExpression(url: string)`
  If the Perspective View implements selection capabilities, this methods selects the given expression.
