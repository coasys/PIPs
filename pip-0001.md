# What is a PIP?
PIP is the short-form for Perspect3vism Improvement Proposal.
PIPs introduce definitions and specifications for the 
Perspect3vism community to align efforts and build compatible
components, as well as suggest, track and communicate architectural
and other decisions.

## How to add a PIP?
PIPs get added through pull-requests, which also serve as a discussion thread.

Merging that PR means accepting the PIP.

## Format of PIPs
TBD
